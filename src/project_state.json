  "summary": "Build a promotional presale website for the IcpMemeDoge memecoin featuring a special meme-dog hero image, flashy but readable design, a 24h countdown, and an ICP-based presale flow with automated payment detection, progress tracking to a 515,000 ICP cap, contributor address listing, and post-presale token crediting.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Integrate with the Internet Computer/ICP ledger (or an indexer) to monitor the presale address for incoming transfers and compute cumulative raised ICP.",
    "Persist contribution records (sender address, amount, timestamp) to support progress calculation and contributor list display.",
    "Enforce presale cap logic: stop accepting/acknowledging contributions once total received reaches 515,000 ICP and mark presale as ended.",
    "Decide on approach for animated hero dog (CSS animation on layered PNG/SVG, animated SVG, Lottie/WebM) and ensure it remains lightweight and doesn’t reduce readability/performance.",
    "Decide how to handle background audio on first visit (autoplay restrictions, user consent/controls, mute/volume, and accessibility considerations).",
    "Background audio requirement: autoplay a “cool 90s dance” track on initial page entry (while still respecting browser autoplay restrictions and providing user controls/consent as needed).",
    "Background music should start only after an explicit user action (pressing the Play button), to comply with autoplay restrictions and user consent expectations.",
    "Presale deposit address is a configurable constant used both for UI display/copy and for ledger monitoring; must be updated consistently when changed.",
    "Clarify and implement post-presale “Listungen” behavior: whether this is a static section (planned exchanges + dates/links) or dynamic updates/admin-managed content shown after presale ends.",
    "Presale monitoring should mirror ic.house transaction history 1:1 (fields + newest-first ordering) for the deposit account, and auto-refresh via existing polling without manual submission."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "UI bug: 'ICP remaining' field should display the cap as '515.000 ICP' (German thousands separator) when no contributions are received; currently incorrect value/format.",
    "Deployment/build failed during packaging/push to network; deployment error needs repair/enablement.",
    "Bug: Latest Transactions / contributions monitoring is not showing current on-chain transactions (user reports at least 3 missing) for presale address d1850dd067fb2302bd635b0de944dcb52530490348ef1b6210bd4bdb490f0fe9 compared to https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/d1850dd067fb2302bd635b0de944dcb52530490348ef1b6210bd4bdb490f0fe9",
    "Presale status/stand (raised/remaining and transaction list) may not match the current on-chain state for the presale deposit address shown on the IC dashboard; needs reconciliation and correct syncing of transactions to displayed presale progress.",
    "Presale/Latest Transactions/Contributors data must be reconciled against the IC dashboard transaction_flow view for the deposit account (not currently matching).",
    "Performance issue: site loads too slowly, likely due to ic.house transaction sync/polling waiting on slow responses and blocking or delaying UI rendering.",
    "Frontend shows “Awaiting Transaction Sync” placeholder because backend does not yet provide real presale stats/contributions endpoints (only getHealth), so usePresaleStatus/useContributors render static/empty data."
