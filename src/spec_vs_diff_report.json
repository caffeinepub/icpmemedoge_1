  "summary": "Diff updates the background music controller UI to show a Play button when not playing (with retryable error banner) and shows mute/volume controls when playing. The hook now creates a singleton Audio element using the required asset path, syncs isPlaying via audio events, attempts opt-in-based autoplay with unblock-on-interaction listeners, and sets a user-facing error on audio load failure. Some REQ-25 acceptance-criteria behaviors (opt-in storage, userInitiatedPlay implementation details, and persistence behavior) cannot be fully verified due to truncation of useBackgroundMusic.ts.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "After a page reload (with opt-in stored), music either plays automatically or, if blocked by browser policy, starts upon the next user interaction per the existing unblock logic; and existing mute/unmute and volume persistence behavior continues to work as before.",
      "reason": "The diff shows logic for opt-in-based autoplay and unblock listeners, and it loads saved preferences, but the file is truncated before showing the remainder (including userInitiatedPlay() and any opt-in/volume persistence writes). Therefore, it cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary that opt-in is saved on Play, that the full unblock logic is correctly wired through reloads, or that mute/volume persistence 'continues to work as before' end-to-end.",
