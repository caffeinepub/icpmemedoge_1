  "summary": "REQ-12 and REQ-13 appear implemented by applying a subtle continuous animation to the existing hero image via Tailwind (`motion-safe:animate-hero-float`) while keeping the exact image src path unchanged, and leveraging `motion-safe` to respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. However, the diff also includes additional Hero content changes (feature cards / other presentation changes) that were not requested under the stated non-goals.",

    {
      "description": "Added/changed additional Hero section content beyond the hero image animation (e.g., the new 'Key Features' card grid with multiple feature tiles).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals state to only adjust the hero image presentation/animation and not introduce new sections/changes beyond that. The diff shows added/expanded non-image UI elements within the Hero section.",
