  "summary": "The diff updates documentation/implementation details in the background-music hook and metadata files, and it still references the required audio path. However, there is no evidence in the diff summary that the actual bundled audio asset at /assets/audio/background-dance.mp3 was replaced or included at the correct static location, so the core “swap the track” requirement is not demonstrably implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Replace the bundled background music audio that plays when the user presses the floating Play button with “Binary Finary 1999”, while keeping the existing audio URL/path unchanged (\"/assets/audio/background-dance.mp3\").",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows only TypeScript/metadata changes and continued use of the same audio path, but does not show any replacement of the actual audio content that would make the Play button play the new track.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useBackgroundMusic.ts (truncated) (only references /assets/audio/background-dance.mp3; no asset change shown)"

      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "Ensure the updated bundled audio asset is included as a static frontend asset at the existing location used by the app (\"/assets/audio/background-dance.mp3\"), without introducing additional audio files/paths for playback.",
      "reason": "No audio/static asset file changes are shown (no added/modified .mp3 or public/assets entry), so inclusion of the updated audio at the required path cannot be verified from this diff summary.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: Added: 0 (no new asset files listed)",
        "Modified files list does not include any static asset (e.g., public/assets/audio/background-dance.mp3)"
