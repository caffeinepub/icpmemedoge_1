  "summary": "The diff implements the requested reliability and UX improvements for background music playback: adds an explicit \"starting\" state with disabled Play button + spinner/text, improves error display and retry-ability, and keeps the audio asset path at \"/assets/audio/background-dance.mp3\". No evidence in the provided diff indicates changes to Shadcn UI component files or introduction of first-visit autoplay, but the hook file is truncated so autoplay behavior cannot be fully verified from the snippet alone.",
