  "summary": "REQ-40 appears implemented in PresaleProgress: 'ICP Remaining' now defaults to the full cap when status is undefined/null or when received is zero, and it uses a dot-thousands formatter via formatIcpWithDots(). However, the diff also introduces/contains a new presale-ended badge with celebratory emoji text that was not requested.",

      "description": "Added/introduced a prominent 'PRESALE ENDED' badge with celebratory emoji and thank-you message in the Presale Progress component.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest REQ-40 only asks to correct the 'ICP Remaining' displayed value/format; it explicitly lists non-goals about not changing layout/styling beyond what is necessary. The added badge content goes beyond adjusting the remaining ICP display.",
